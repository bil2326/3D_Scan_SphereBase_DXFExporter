# 3D_Scan_SphereBase_DXFExporter
This project automates the processing of 3D scan data of metallic beams using spheres. It calculates the precise positions of sphere bases relative to a chosen reference, visualizes them in 2D (X-Z plane), and exports the results directly to a DXF file that can be overlaid on an existing CAD plan.
